        Although existing blockchain programmability layers have achieved significant adoption,
        we see they are

        made in terms of scalability, decentralization, and security.
        We believe this is an inevitable consequence of choosing PoS as the core consensus principle and settling for
        a technical roadmap that promotes endless fragmentation.
        This approach merely produces variations of the same technological stack,offering little
        to no benefit for users, institutions, or retail participants alike.

        Until recently, technological limitations prevented integrating modern VMs with PoW-based systems.
        While BitVM and zkVMs have made Bitcoin ZK rollups possible,
        native ZK verification on Bitcoin lacks a clear timeline. Even when implemented,
        these rollups can only use Bitcoin's base layer for settlement,

        By establishing transaction ordering at L1 and deterministically derive the L2 state directly from
